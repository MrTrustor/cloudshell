- [ ] Google Cloud Run?

- [ ] allow building containers, and push, and run (remote) - from inside this container!

- [ ] auth with webauthn

- [ ] ssh-agent based on webauthn (like https://krypt.co/developers does, [see here](https://github.com/kryptco/kr/blob/master/src/krd/main.go))

- [ ] update xterm and hterm version embedded in GoTTY

- [ ] how/where to set LANG = en.UTF-8  (instead of default C.UTF-8)

- [ ] even with better LANG `pstree` output is still "not nice"- why? Or is better after xterm/hterm update?  Different in the two?
